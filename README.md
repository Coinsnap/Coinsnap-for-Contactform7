### 2. Configure the Coinsnap for Contact Form 7-plugin ###

After the Coinsnap for Contact Form 7 plugin is installed and activated, a notice appears that the plugin still needs to be configured.

To do this, you need a Coinsnap account first.

### 2.1 Create your Coinsnap account ###

Open your Coinsnap account at https://app.coinsnap.io/register by simply entering your email address and a password of your choice.
